Desc: Our AI works based on a point system that assigns a value of either 100, 50, or 0 to every move
available for the computer. 100 if the move is a winning move, 50 if the move does not result in a win
or loss, and 0 if the move results in a loss. The computer then choses the move that has the highest score.
Before each game, you are able select RIGHT, LEFT, or RANDOM and these options will represent your 
tiebreaker type in the case of a tie game. To win this game you only have to connect four of your X's or O's
in a row. The variant we added to this game is that if a column if filled up, it is cleared for the ext move.
This rule is similar to the Tetris rule that clears rows as they fill up, only with a TWSIST! now the columns 
are cleared as they fill up.
